# lab-utils-PoC

This is a proof of concept for deploying the boilerplate code shared among all of the PEP lab activities. We can simply upload the JARs in the proper format to an S3 bucket and set that location as the repote repository to fetch dependencies. 

There is already a simple bucket set up with this dependency to be used with the [lab-activity-PoC](https://github.com/LiquidPlummer/lab-activity-PoC)
